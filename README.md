Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize sales performance across multiple dimensions.
The dashboard highlights sales trends over time, top-performing products and stores, and provides a detailed view of customer data segmented by membership tiers.
Regional distribution of sales is mapped for quick geographic insights, while store-level filters enable performance comparison across different time periods for different stores. 
This project demonstrates strong skills in data modeling, DAX measures, and visualization design, delivering actionable insights for business decision-making.
